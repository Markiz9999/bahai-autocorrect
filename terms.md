Huwa (Pers. Huva) | Huwa | he; it (3rd pers. m. sing. of the pers. pronoun); God (or “the Most Great Name of God” according to the Báb). Huwa (“he” or “he is”) in the context of “‘He is’ God” is often incorrectly understood (as in the definition) to be the name of God. In the Bible it is represented in Hebrew by the tetragrammaton “yhwh”, sometimes pronounced as Yahweh. However, the Jews were forbidden to utter the name of God, and as ancient Hebrew script did not use vowels, it is not known how yhwh would have been pronounced, if it was permitted. If we say “yá huwa” in Arabic in reference to God, it means “O He is …”. Since Hebrew and Arabic are sister languages, it is not surprising that “yá huwa” sounds like Yahweh, which has commonly been represented by Jehovah. (In some European languages the “J” is pronounced as “Y”, “V” as “U”, and “W” as “UU”.) See note under Bahá’.

Subuhat al-Jalal, Subuhat-i-Jalal | Subuḥát al-Jalál, Pers. Subuḥát-i-Jalál | literally “lofty praises of the majesty of God” or “lofty praises of divine glory”—this suggests we must rigorously avoid equating our understanding (and therefore our ‘self’) of sublime divine qualities with the absolute unknowable essence of God. Hence Shoghi Effendi translated this expression in Bahá’u’lláh’s Writings as “veils of glory”. Those affected by the “veils of glory” could be described as suffering from “delusions of grandeur”.
